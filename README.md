# ML-Models

Implemented various machine learning models as part of CPSC-340 at UBC.

## knn.py
Implemented the k-neighbours classifier using either.

## svm.py
Implemented a multi-class support vector machine by minimizing the hinge loss using gradient descent.

## softmax.py
Implemented multi-class logistic regression by minimizing the softmax loss using gradient descent

## mlp.py
Implemented a multi-layer perceptron (neural network) using the sigmoid activation.
